Sircoin - The ultimate shitcoin!
=====================================


What is Sircoin?
----------------

Sircoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Sircoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Sircoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For a binary version of the Sircoin Core software, see [the releases page.](https://github.com/sys-256/sircoin/releases)

License
-------

Sircoin Core is a fork of [Sircoin Core](https://github.com/sircoin-project/sircoin), and therefore is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more
information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/sys-256/sircoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Sircoin Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
and useful hints for developers can be found in [doc/developer-notes.md](doc/developer-notes.md).

Translations
------------

We only accept translation fixes that are submitted through [Bitcoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoin/).
Translations are converted to Sircoin periodically.

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.
